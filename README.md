# Microservices: a Password Management System

This project implements a secure, scalable password management system using a microservices architecture. It provides users with a centralized platform to store, manage, and access their passwords while ensuring robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and local development
- Python 3.12 or later
- Flask web framework
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM
- Werkzeug for utilities (including password hashing)
- SQLite for local development (easily adaptable to PostgreSQL for production)

## > Authentication Service
Responsible for user registration, login, and token-based authentication.
## > Password Management Service
Handles CRUD operations for password entries, ensuring only authorized users can access specific passwords.


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```
### 2. Database Setup:
The application uses SQLite for development. You can initialize the database by running:
```bash
python3 create_db.py
```
#### Switching to PostgreSQL:
To switch to PostgreSQL, modify the docker-compose.yml file to uncomment and configure the database services.

### 3. Build and Run the Services
To build and run the microservices using Docker Compose, execute the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will build the Docker images and start the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

### 4. Access the Services
- Authentication Service: http://localhost:5001

- Password Service: http://localhost:5002


## Contributing
